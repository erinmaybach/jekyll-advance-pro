Abstract: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNAs that play a crucial role in regulating gene expression. Dysfunction in miRNAs can lead to various diseases, including cancers, neurological disorders, and cardiovascular conditions. To date, approximately 2000 miRNAs have been identified in humans. These small molecules have shown promise as disease biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets. Therefore, identifying miRNA biomarkers for diseases and developing effective miRNA drug delivery systems are essential. Nanotechnology offers promising new approaches to addressing scientific and medical challenges. Traditional miRNA detection methods include next-generation sequencing, microarrays, Northern blotting, and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Nanotechnology can serve as an effective alternative to Northern blotting and RT-qPCR for miRNA detection. Moreover, nanomaterials exhibit unique properties that differ from larger counterparts, enabling miRNA therapeutics to more effectively enter target cells, reduce degradation in the bloodstream, and be released in specific tissues or cells. This paper reviews the application of nanotechnology in miRNA detection and drug delivery systems. Given that miRNA therapeutics are still in the developing stages, nanotechnology holds great promise for accelerating miRNA therapeutics development.
