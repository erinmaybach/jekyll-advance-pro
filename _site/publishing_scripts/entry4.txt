Abstract: Motivation: A growing number of genomes are sequenced. The differences in evolutionary pattern between functional regions can thus be observed genome-wide in a whole set of organisms. The diverse evolutionary pattern of different functional regions can be exploited in the process of genomic annotation. The modelling of evolution by the existing comparative gene finders leaves room for improvement.
