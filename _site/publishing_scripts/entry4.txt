Abstract: Foundation models in transcriptomics have gained attention due to their ability to generalize across tasks with limited labeled data. GeneCompass builds upon these models by incorporating prior biological knowledge and datasets from both human and mouse cells, enhancing its capacity for cross-species analysis and advancing the field of single-cell transcriptomics.
