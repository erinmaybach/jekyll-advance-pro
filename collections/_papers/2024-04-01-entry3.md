# Abstract
 > Nitrogen (N) deficiency responses are essential for plant survival and reproduction. Here, via an expression genome-wide association study (eGWAS), we reveal a mechanism that regulates microRNA (miRNA) dynamics necessary for N deficiency responses in Arabidopsis. Differential expression levels of three NAC transcription factor (TF) genes involved in leaf N deficiency responses among Arabidopsis accessions are most significantly associated with polymorphisms in HASTY (HST), which encodes an importin/exportin family protein responsible for the generation of mature miRNAs. HST acts as a negative regulator of N deficiency-induced leaf senescence, and the disruption and overexpression of HST differently modifies miRNA dynamics in response to N deficiency, altering levels of miRNAs targeting transcripts. Interestingly, N deficiency prevents the interaction of HST with HST-interacting proteins, DCL1 and RAN1, and some miRNAs. This suggests that HST-mediated regulation of miRNA dynamics collectively controls regulations mediated by multiple N deficiency response-associated NAC TFs, thereby being central to the N deficiency response network.
