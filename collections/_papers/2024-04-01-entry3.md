# Abstract
 > Bacteria are highly adaptable and grow in diverse niches, where they often interact with eukaryotic organisms. These interactions with different hosts span the entire spectrum from symbiosis to pathogenicity and thus determine the lifestyle of the bacterium. Knowledge of the genetic determinants involved in animal and plant host colonization by pathogenic and mutualistic bacteria is not only crucial to discover new drug targets for disease management but also for developing novel biostimulant strategies. In the last decades, significant progress in genome-wide high-throughput technologies such as transposon insertion sequencing has led to the identification of pathways that enable efficient host colonization. However, the extent to which similar genes play a role in this process in different bacteria is yet unclear. This review highlights the commonalities and specificities of bacterial determinants important for bacteria–host interaction.
