<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>Software Carpentry has published one of my favorite textbooks, Practical Computing for Biologists, and their online tutorials are just as informative. This site is an excellent resource for beginners who want to learn the basics of programming and skills. Their target audience is biologists and the tutorials do an exceptional job of linking the skills they teach to biological principles. While all of their Unix shell tutorials are useful, I particularly enjoy the â€˜Loopsâ€™ and â€˜Pipes and Filtersâ€™ tutorial. These two skills are crucial in eliminating repetitive manual data entry, which becomes significant when working with a large volume of data files.</p>

<p>The equivalent of Mr. Miyagiâ€™s â€œWax on Wax offâ€ approach to programming basics that sets you up for success!</p>
